<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born in Taiwan but moved to US when I was about 10 years old. During my teenage years, I discovered computer and quickly
  took a liking to it and start taking it apart with my best friend. We would study different part and understand what is inside
  the PC. However, during college, I majored in biology. An area that I am interested in and understand it pretty well. I only took 
  on one course of computer class as elective. As much as I love the class and the writing codes, at the time I felt it was
  too much for me to keep up, so I stick with biology that I can handle easily.

<p>After graduation, I went to school for cytogenetic and now work in the cytogentics lab in MD Anderson Cancer Center. While working
  here, I've continued my education and decided to pick up what I've liked since I was teens and pursuit computer science degree. 
  After graduating, I started to look for new jobs but before I gotten any offers, my daughter is born and I decided to put my career
  change to a holt and focus on raising and spending more time with her.

<p>As time passes and my daughter grew and now started going to school, I have time for myself and see the opportunity to obtain a masters
  degree in cybersecurity. As cyber threats increased, this seems like a great career field. Now I've graduated on July of 2025 with my
master's degree in cybersecurity and with computer science background, I am ready to start a new challenge. </p>
